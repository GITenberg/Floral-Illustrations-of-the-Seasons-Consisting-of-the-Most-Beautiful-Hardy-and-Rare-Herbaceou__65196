<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,
</p>

<p>In dedicating this Work to you, I am not presumptuous
enough to believe that I can offer anything novel in a botanical
point of view, though I am sure you are too generous a patron of
the science to discourage any effort, however feeble, which has for
its object the diffusion of a taste for such pursuits: my motives,
however, are not of this nature; I would offer it to you as a mark
of respect and affection, but more particularly of gratitude, for the
warm attachment you have ever evinced towards me, which has
contributed so much to the happiness of my life. With these sentiments,
allow me to subscribe myself,</p>

<p class="r">
Your affectionate Daughter,</p>

<p>The present state of botanical knowledge renders it impossible for the
Author of this Work to indulge in a hope, that she can add anything to the
learning and research which distinguish the science: as a humble follower
of those who have added so much to our information on these subjects, she
would walk in their delightful paths, and gather some of those objects of
beauty which lie scattered around her. To endeavour to place them in an
attractive form&mdash;to attach to them useful and accurate information&mdash;has
been her pleasing task; and she will be amply rewarded if she should be
the means of affording any encouragement, particularly among her own
sex, to a taste for botanical pursuits. One of our greatest philosophers has
declared a "Garden to be among the purest of human pleasures"; and if
we look for a still higher sanction&mdash;we have the divine command to</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">"Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow."</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There is no pursuit which fills the mind with more noble and exalted
sentiments than the study of these works of Nature:&mdash;wherever we turn
our attention, we shall discover in them ample lessons of instruction and
delight; in the structure of every plant, we shall find the most exact
symmetry, and the most perfect contrivance&mdash;and the more minutely we
examine, the more decided traces we discern of that Power</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">"Who planned, and built, and still upholds a world</div>
<div class="verse indent0">So clothed with beauty."</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The gratification to be derived from such pursuits, is heightened by considerations
like these, and their utility and value are rendered still more
evident. To use the language of the late excellent and distinguished <span class="smcap">Sir
James E. Smith</span>, "Is it not desirable to call the soul from the feverish
agitation of worldly pursuits, to the contemplation of divine wisdom in the
beautiful economy of Nature? Is it not a privilege to walk with God in the
garden of creation, and hold converse with his providence? If such elevated
feelings do not lead to the study of Nature, it cannot be far pursued without
rewarding the student by exciting them."</p>

<p>In the arrangement of this Work, the Author has aimed at some degree
of novelty in the design, as well as of utility in the information. To her
own sex, to whose particular notice she offers it, she trusts it may prove a
useful and correct guide to their tastes, both in their selection for a flower
garden, and as objects for their pencil. She has chosen those plants most
remarkable for their beauty, and general adaptation to our borders&mdash;and,
in order to render the Work more complete, she has added to every genus
those species most desirable for cultivation.</p>

<p>The Author cannot conclude, without expressing her obligations for the
assistance afforded her by her friend <span class="smcap">Mr. Shepherd</span>, Curator of the Botanic
Garden, Liverpool; and her thanks are particularly due to his able and
intelligent coadjutor, <span class="smcap">Mr. Henry Shepherd</span>, F.L.S.</p>

<p>The species here figured is the earliest and best known in our
gardens. It was introduced into this country in the year 1629, and
derives its specific denomination from the ancient name of that part
of Europe where it abounds in a wild state. Numerous varieties of
the genus are constantly raised from seed, but the number of distinct
species do not exceed ten or twelve. The cultivation of these plants
is attended with no difficulty whatever: they will grow in any soil
or situation; and the C. mæsiacus increases so rapidly as to require
frequent parting. The different varieties make a beautiful display in
the months of February and March, if placed in alternate patches in
the flower border, and produce a brilliant effect when expanded by the
warmth of the sun. The most desirable for a flower garden are the
following species and their varieties:&mdash;</p>

<p>The blue variety of the Hepatica triloba, which blooms about
March, is one of our most beautiful Spring flowers, and is more readily
cultivated than any of the other kinds. According to Pursh, "It is a
native of Canada, and is found in woods, and on the sides of fertile
and rocky hills." The double variety of this plant is less common in
our gardens, and the single white variety is rare. These plants like
a loamy soil, and eastern exposure&mdash;and should be removed when they
are in blossom. The roots do not bear to be often separated; and
if divided into small pieces are frequently lost: but if left undisturbed
in a congenial situation, they will attain great luxuriance. Miller
says the single varieties are easily propagated by seed; but our
more modern gardeners do not coincide in this opinion. The new
leaves do not appear until after the flowers, though occasionally those
of the preceding year retain their freshness, as in the figure here
given. All the Hepaticas are ornamental.</p>

<p>This beautiful plant is a native of the West of England, though
rarely found. It likes a light soil, and should be grown in large
patches, when it forms one of the greatest ornaments to our gardens
in the month of March. The white variety also flowers about the
same time, and forms a striking and beautiful contrast if placed
alternately in the flower border. It is increased by offsets, which
may be removed when the leaves decay. If this plant be covered with
a hand-glass, when coming into bloom, it will expand more fully, and
preserve the brilliancy of its colour. The Scilla maritima possesses
peculiar medicinal properties. The most beautiful species are</p>

<p>This plant is one of the least common and most beautiful of the

a native of Spain, and was introduced into this country about the year
1759. It requires a light rich soil; and, like all other bulbs, ought
only to be removed when the leaves decay. The plant grows from
twelve to sixteen inches high, and flowers in April. The genus
Narcissus is a very numerous and beautiful one, and affords a
delightful variety. Some of the most ornamental are</p>

<p>There are few plants more desirable for a flower garden than the
Erythronium dens canis, and its white variety; and none contribute
more to the beauty of our borders in the month of March, or beginning
of April. It is a native of Hungary, and some parts of Italy, and was
introduced into this country in the year 1596. These plants like a
light soil, mixed with bog, and are propagated by offsets, which may
be removed any time after the leaves decay; but the roots should
not be kept long out of the ground, as they are liable to shrink.
Miller mentions two species of the lilac Erythronium; but his distinctions,
founded only on the breadth of the leaves, and colour of
the flower, would not be sufficient to form a different species. It is,
however, worthy of remark, that the leaves of those bulbs which do
not bear flowers, are broader and rounder than the others. There are
two other species, mentioned by Pursh, in his "Flora of North America,"
vol. i. p. 230, both bearing yellow flowers, one of which is
occasionally seen in our gardens.&mdash;Erythronium Americanum.</p>

<p>Though this plant has been long known in our gardens, having
been introduced in the year 1629, it is by no means common. It
is found wild on the mountains of Switzerland, and in different parts
of Austria. It likes a rich loamy soil, and is increased by parting the
roots; but to have it in perfection it should be grown in large patches,
and seldom divided, when it makes a beautiful appearance in the flower
garden in the months of March or April. In its native country, this
plant does not exceed four inches in height, and the flowers are of a
much more brilliant colour. There are two other species of Adonis,
but they are seldom met with.</p>

<p>This plant is a native of Switzerland, and was introduced into
this country about the year 1596. It is the parent of all the beautiful
varieties of Auricula, which are now cultivated in our gardens. It
grows low, and, like many of the genus, is suitable and ornamental
for rock work. The Primulas flourish most in a mixture of loam,
decayed leaves, and bog earth, and, like all Alpine plants, require a
pure atmosphere. The leaves of this species are apt to vary in form,
the margins occasionally being entire. Some of the most beautiful

<p>This beautiful species, which is much larger than the Sanguinaria
Canadensis, was introduced into this country about the year 1812, by
the late Mr. John Lyon, with several other valuable plants, collected
by him in different parts of North America. It takes its name from
the root, which, when broken, emits a red juice resembling blood, with
which the Indians are said to paint themselves. Its blossoms are
transient, and, like many other Spring flowers, require the warmth of
the sun to expand them. It grows best in bog soil and a sheltered
situation, and may be increased by parting its roots, which should be
done in the Autumn, to prevent any check to its flowering in the
following March or April. There is only another species, the S.
Canadensis, above alluded to.</p>

<p>Though this beautiful plant has been so long known in our

which perhaps may be accounted for by the liability of the roots to
decay in cold wet soils. It is a native of Siberia, flowers in May, and
makes a brilliant appearance when grown in large patches. The
Pæonias grow best in a rich loamy soil, and may be increased by
parting the roots, or by seed; by the latter means several most beautiful
varieties have been raised of the Pæonia moutan, of which a full
account may be seen in the "Hor. Soc. Trans.," vol. 6. This is a
remarkably handsome genus. Some of the most ornamental are</p>

<p>The genus Phlox is perhaps one of the most beautiful cultivated
in our gardens, and affords a delightful variety, its different species
flowering all through the Summer and Autumn. The plant here
figured is the earliest; and though it cannot boast of brilliancy, it is
remarkable for the beautiful delicacy of its colour, and modest appearance.
It grows low, seldom exceeding eight or ten inches in height,
and is, on this account, very suitable for rock work. It flowers in
May, likes a strong loamy soil, and is increased by parting the roots,
or by cuttings. This species is a native of the mountains of Virginia,
North America, and was brought into this country by the late
Mr. Fraser. There are various others equally desirable for a flower
garden. Amongst the most beautiful are</p>

<p>This is a most striking and ornamental species, and though it is
said to have been introduced so far back as the year 1597, is still
rare in our gardens. It is difficult to cultivate, perhaps requiring a
little stronger soil than Anemonies generally do. When its roots
have attained a great size, it should be removed or divided, as it is
then liable to decay; few, however, are fortunate enough to cultivate
it to such a state of luxuriance. It is perfectly hardy, though mostly
treated as a frame plant. The under side of the lower radical leaves
is tinged with a bright violet colour. The genus Anemone is a
numerous one, and can boast of many ornamental species.</p>

<p>This beautiful plant, according to the "Bot. Mag.," 2680, is a
native of Hudson's Bay, and was "Originally introduced to the Kew
Gardens by the late Dr. Solander, in 1778." It is still rare, and
difficult to cultivate, though in congenial situations it will sow its seed,
and increase abundantly; but the general method of propagating it
is by parting the roots. The plant from which the annexed drawing
was made grows luxuriantly in a cold, stiff soil, and has endured our
severest winters without protection. It flowers in June; and though
each blossom falls off almost as soon as it becomes perfect, there is a
succession for a considerable time. The most beautiful species of this

<p>This lovely little plant is a native of the mountains of Austria

is well adapted by its low growth and general habit. It was introduced
into this country about the year 1779, but is still very seldom
met with. It is hardy, though like many Alpine plants is liable to be
lost in the Winter unless protected, and it is therefore the safest plan
either to keep it in a frame, or to cover it with dry leaves and a hand
glass during Winter. It flowers in June, likes a light rich soil, and
is increased by parting the roots. The genus Campanula is a very
numerous one, consisting of upwards of sixty species: some of the
most ornamental are&mdash;</p>

<p>The specific name of this very interesting plant was given by
Professor Nuttal, in consequence of what he considered the three-lobed
form of its petals; this is however so very slight as to be scarcely
observable, and therefore perhaps ought not to be considered a specific
distinction. It was discovered by the Professor in the Arkansas
country, in 1819, and seeds were afterwards brought by that indefatigable
traveller and naturalist, Mr. D. Douglas, from North
America, in 1824. This plant, which has a succession of flowers
throughout the Summer, is extremely liable to decay, if not kept dry
in the Winter; but it may be raised from seed, or by parting the roots
in Autumn, and keeping them in a frame, in pots of light dry soil,
giving them very little or no water until the roots begin to shoot in
the Spring. This is the best method of increasing the Œ. cespitosa,
a most lovely plant, but extremely difficult to propagate. There are
numerous species and varieties of this very interesting genus: some of
the most beautiful are&mdash;</p>

<p>This very beautiful and singular annual was named by Pursh, in
honour of Captain Clark, the companion of Captain Lewis, whose
interesting travels across the continent of North America are so well
known. It was found by Mr. Douglas, in the countries around the
Columbia river, and brought by him into this country, to the Horticultural
Society. The plant is hardy; but to facilitate its bloom, the
seeds should be sown in a hotbed early in the Spring, and when the
plants have acquired sufficient strength they may be removed to the
borders, where they will continue to flower until destroyed by frost.
This is the only species known of this genus.</p>

it in Nipal, and sent seeds of it to this country. It is now
becoming generally known, and is a great acquisition to our gardens,
both for the beauty of its flower and continuing so long in blossom.
A light loam suits it best; and when it likes the situation it will sow
itself, and is therefore easily propagated. The genus Potentilla is not
a showy one, but there are several pretty species:&mdash;</p>

<p>This elegant flower was originally discovered by Mr. Menzies,
during the expedition of Vancouver, in the year 1792, on the coast of
California. It has been named by Chamisso after Dr. Eschscholtz, a
companion of Kotzebue, in his voyage round the world, and was sent
to the Hort. Soc., by Mr. Douglas, in 1826, who found it on the N. W.
coast of America. It promises to be a very desirable and beautiful
addition to our catalogue of herbaceous plants, flowering abundantly
all thro' the summer 'till destroyed by frost. It may be propagated
either by seeds, which should be sown in a hot-bed early in the spring,
or by parting the roots in autumn, and grows best in a pure air, and a
light, or sandy soil.</p>

<p>There are only two species known of this genus, the one here
figured is a native of the South of Europe, and is said to have been
cultivated by Parkinson as far back as the year 1640, it is however by
no means a common plant, owing perhaps to the difficulty of keeping
it through the winter, when it is very apt to be destroyed by frost; it
is easily raised from seeds which may be sown in the autumn, and if
protected during the winter, will make strong plants to flower through
the ensuing summer, continuing in beauty until the approach of winter&mdash;it
likes a dry, sandy soil, and will not bear frequent removal,&mdash;the
other species, Catananche lutea, is an annual not deserving of cultivation.</p>

<p>This distinct species, which is perhaps one of the most beautiful of
the genus is readily distinguished by its small flower and foliage&mdash;it is
a native of Mexico, and previous to its introduction to this country, by
Mr. Fraser, in 1803, was cultivated in France,&mdash;endless varieties of
this genus are constantly raised from seed, and by other means, and
there is no flower to which we are so much indebted for ornamenting
our gardens in the Autumn&mdash;the cultivation of this plant is so easy,
and now so well known that little requires to be said on this point.
Particular care, however, must be taken to keep the roots from frost; a
poor soil will cause a smaller growth, and produce more flowers.
The name Georgina was given to this genus by Wildenow, in honor of
G. Georgi, a Russian Botanist, and as it is considered by the Continental
and many English Botanists, to be the most correct, it has been
here adopted, instead of Dahlia, a name very similar to that of another
genus (Dalea) called after Dale the friend of Ray;<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> some of the most
beautiful double Georginas are varieties of the Sambucifolia.</p>

a gay appearance in the Autumn. R. hirta is perhaps one of the most
desirable, from its moderate size, seldom growing higher than two feet&mdash;it
was introduced about the year 1714, it is a native of N. America,
and is found on the mountains from Virginia to Florida&mdash;it likes a
light rich soil, and is propagated by parting the roots, which should be
done in the spring, as it flowers so late in Autumn as to prevent the
removal in sufficient time for the plants to be well established before

and was raised from seeds sent by Humboldt and Bonpland, to this
country, about the year 1809&mdash;it is a plant of easy cultivation, and is
readily increased by parting the roots in Spring&mdash;it is hardy, but in
the winter requires to be kept dry, as it is liable to decay from too
much moisture, it is therefore the safest plan to put a few plants in a

<p>The first introduction of the Chinese Chrysanthemums into this
country, was about the year 1764;&mdash;the beautiful varieties now seen in
our gardens, became known at a much more recent period, and from
the great facility that attends their cultivation, and their very desirable
season of flowering, they are universal favorites;&mdash;new varieties are
frequently imported, the only means we possess of obtaining them, as
we are ignorant of the mode adopted by the Chinese for their increase;
and we are led to suppose that we do not yet possess some of their
finest kinds:&mdash;most of the varieties will grow well out of doors, and if
trained against a south wall, with a little protection to shield the
flowers from inclement weather, will make a beautiful and gay appearance
in the months of November and December. The Chrysanthemums
are increased either by cuttings or suckers taken from the parent
plant in the spring;&mdash;the var. here figured is a very beautiful one, and
blossoms rather early and freely&mdash;the flowers have a deeper color when
grown out of doors, and the plant altogether acquires more strength;&mdash;in
a green-house this var. is apt to grow weak and tall.</p>

<p>This plant possesses little beauty to recommend it to our notice,
but its delightful fragrance, which strongly resembles the Heliotropium
Peruvianum, renders it an acceptable addition to our small stock of
winter flowers. It is a native of Italy, and was introduced into this
country by Messrs. Lee and Kennedy, in 1806. Though frequently
treated as a green-house or frame-plant, it is perfectly hardy, and if
grown in a moist situation, it will spread so rapidly as to become
troublesome; the best plan therefore is to confine it in a pot, and
plunge it in common garden soil, where it will flower about December
or January, without the least protection.</p>

<p>This is the only species suitable for a flower garden.</p>

<p>There are few flowers more welcome to us than the Helleborus
niger, which enlivens our gardens in the dreary months of December
and January. It is a native of the mountains of Austria, and was
introduced into this country about the year 1596, by Mr. John Gerard;
it derives its name from the dark color of its roots, and the common
appellation of the Christmas Rose, arises from the peculiar season of
its flowering; being an alpine plant it delights in a pure air, and it
grows best in a moist situation and strong loamy soil: it may be covered
with a hand-glass when coming into bloom, as the beauty of the flower
is liable to be destroyed by the severity of the weather. Considerable
medicinal properties were ascribed to this plant by the ancients, but it
is now seldom used. There are several other species, but only two of
these are generally cultivated&mdash;the first mentioned is a British plant.</p>

<p>The genus Eranthis, which was established by Salisbury, differs from
Helleborus in the number of its petals and stamens, the latter in
Eranthis are from twenty to thirty, in Helleborus, from thirty to
sixty; the seed in the former genus being in one series, the latter in
two series, the difference of habit, &amp;c., altogether forming good grounds
for making them separate genera. This pretty species which flowers
about January is a native of France, Switzerland, and Austria, and
was cultivated in our gardens as long since as 1596;&mdash;it grows best
in a light loam mixed with bog, and is propagated by offsets. There
is another species Eranthis Siberica.</p>

<p>This pretty little plant would be acceptable to us at any season of
the year, but is peculiarly so in the dreary one in which its beautiful
pink blossoms appear, frequently peeping above the snow. The flowers
are formed in the autumn, but do not come to maturity until the following
December or January, when (if planted in a bog border with a
south aspect) it will make a beautiful appearance for a length of time.
It is a native of the Alps and mountainous parts of Germany, and
was introduced into this country about the year 1763; the general
method of increasing this plant is by cuttings or layers,&mdash;there are
other species of hardy heaths which are well worth cultivating. The
three last mentioned are natives of Britain.</p>

<p>This pretty plant which is one of the earliest of our Spring bulbs,
is a native of the south of Europe, and has been known since the year
1596, when it was cultivated by Mr. John Gerard. It is very hardy,
though generally treated as a green-house or frame plant, and if grown
in a sheltered situation in a mixture of bog earth, and rich loam, it
will flower abundantly, and make a beautiful appearance about February,
particularly if covered with a hand-glass to protect the flowers
from the inclemency of the weather.</p>

<p>This plant is easily raised from seed, which is produced in abundance.
After the petals decay the germen becomes enlarged, and the foot
stalk enclosing it in the centre, twists in the form of a screw, until it
reaches the ground, when the seed-vessel bursts and deposits the seed,
a beautiful provision of nature for propagating the species&mdash;the seeds
thus sown, will require a little more soil, and the protection of a hand-glass
during the Winter, when if not destroyed by frost, the plants will
generally flower the following Summer&mdash;the other hardy species are</p>

medicinal properties than for its beauty, though this species is certainly
a handsome plant and as yet rarely met with:&mdash;it is of later
introduction than Hyoscyamus Physaloides, which has a darker
flower, the leaves perfectly smooth, and the plant altogether is of
smaller growth. H. Orientalis is a native of Iberia, a country
between the Black and Caspian Seas, and was first introduced into
this country from seeds sent to Mr. John Hunneman, about the
year 1821; it is perfectly hardy, likes a rich soil, and may be increased
by parting the roots or by seed; flowers as early as March. There is
only another species besides the two mentioned, deserving of cultivation
in a flower garden, which is H. Scopoli.</p>

<p>The beautiful genus Soldanella is peculiarly adapted to rock
work, to which it is a great ornament; the different species are all
hardy, but like many alpine plants, require shelter from severe frosts,
as a substitute for the snow of their native mountains; this species is
found on the mountains of Bohemia, and on the Austrian and Styrian
Alps, and was introduced into this country about the year 1816. It
grows best in a mixture of peat and sandy loam, and is readily increased
by seeds, or by parting the roots; the genus is by no means
common, perhaps, from their requiring a very pure air to grow them in
perfection; it is the safest plan to keep all alpine plants in a frame
during winter, or to cover them with <i>dry</i> saw dust, over which may be
placed a hand-glass or garden-pot. This species is called after Clusius
a celebrated Botanist, it being (according to the Bot. Mag. p. 211.)
first described and figured by him. There are two other beautiful
species, with smaller flowers, S. alpina, S. minima.</p>

<p>The genus Viola is a very numerous one, and can boast of many
ornamental species&mdash;endless varieties are constantly raised from seed,
chiefly of Viola tricolor, though these may at first vary, there is
little dependance to be placed on them, as they frequently return to
the original species; the number of distinct species, however, is very
considerable, amongst which is the one figured; a desirable plant for
the front of the borders where it will remain in beauty for a long
time&mdash;it is a native of North America, and according to the Bot.
Cab. p. 1471, grows on dry hills from New England to Virginia.
Prof. Nuttall says in his genera of North American plants, vol. i. p.
147, "the genus Viola within its proper limits, is almost equally
divided betwixt Europe and the temperate parts of North America."
This species was first brought into this country in 1739, though still
a scarce plant in our gardens:&mdash;the Violas are all well adapted for
rock work, and flourish most in a light rich soil and shady situation.
They may be increased either by parting the roots, by cuttings, or by
seeds; the latter of which are produced in great abundance, and are
dispersed by the peculiar elasticity of the capsule, which as soon as
its contents are matured, ejects them with considerable force, sometimes
to a great distance. Some of the most beautiful species are</p>

<p>This is the most desirable species of the genus and a very handsome
herbaceous plant, the beautiful white flowers forming a pleasing
contrast to the dark green leaves by which they are surrounded. It is
a native of Upper Canada, and according to Nuttall, is found generally
in umbrageous forests.&mdash;a peat soil, and shady situation are essential
to its favorable cultivation, and as these are afforded, the flower varies
accordingly in size&mdash;it is a plant of slow growth, not hearing frequent
removal, and is therefore not common, though it has been known in
this country since the year 1799&mdash;flowers about April, and is increased
by parting the roots. The other species are not particularly desirable,
except in extensive herbaceous collections.</p>

none of the species being known here before the year 1826, when
seeds were sent from Chili by Mr. Cruikshanks to the Botanic Gardens
of Edinburgh and Glasgow. The species figured is perhaps the most
beautiful, and promises to be a great acquisition to our collection of
new herbaceous plants, it may be raised from seeds or cuttings, likes a
light soil, and a sheltered situation, and will continue in flower for a
considerable time. It has hitherto been treated chiefly as a green-house
plant, but it will grow much stronger, and the colours finer, in the open
border; it would, however, be desirable to keep some plants in a green-house
or frame during the winter, as it is doubtful how it may bear the
severe frosts. There are only two other species,</p>

<p>This species of Iris, though so long since introduced as the year
1597 is not frequently seen in our herbaceous collections. It is a plant
of low growth, sometimes not exceeding a foot in height, though this
varies according to the soil in which it is planted, a moist situation increasing
its luxuriance both in flower and foliage. It is a native of
Hungary, and is perfectly hardy, not requiring any particular treatment,
and may be increased by separating the roots in Autumn,&mdash;flowers
in May, and grows best in a stiff cold soil. This is a very
beautiful genus, and affords many ornamental species.</p>

<p>The genus Delphinium is a beautiful and showy one, and contains
almost innumerable varieties, none, however, can exceed in
beauty of colour the species figured, which is a native of Siberia, and
was introduced into this country about the year 1741. It is a hardy
plant, of the easiest culture, not requiring any particular treatment,
though it grows best in a rich brown loam&mdash;if allowed to sow its seed,
a number of young plants will soon appear, which will flower the next
year; this mode, however, of propagating it, is by no means certain,
and therefore, in order to obtain it true, it is better to divide the roots,
which may be done in spring; numerous and very beautiful varieties
are constantly raised from seed. Amongst the most desirable distinct
species are</p>

<p>This is one of the most beautiful species of the genus Lilium. It
is rare, perhaps from the difficulty that attends its cultivation, the bulbs
being extremely liable to be lost in the winter from severe frosts or
damp; it is a native of China, and was introduced into this country in
the year 1806. A sheltered situation, and light rich soil, mixed with
bog, are necessary for it, and it is increased by off-sets, which are produced
in tolerable abundance. All the species of Lilium are desirable
for a flower garden.</p>

<p>Great additions have lately been made to this genus, by Mr.
Douglas, who has discovered many new and valuable plants in North
America, among which is the species figured. According to the Bot.
Mag. pl. 2903, N. S. it was found by him "growing plentifully among
the limestone rocks on the high mountains about the grand rapids of
the Columbia river, at the distance of 140 miles from the ocean," and
sent to the Hort. Soc. in 1826; it likes a light loam and sheltered
situation, and may be increased by seeds or parting the roots.
When well grown it is a very beautiful and elegant plant, and a great
acquisition to the flower garden. As we are yet scarcely aware how
it may bear the cold of our winters, it will be desirable to protect it
from severe frosts. The genus can now boast of many new and beautiful
species,</p>

<p>This beautiful plant is a very valuable acquisition to our flower
borders, from the brilliancy of its colour, and affording a continued
succession of flowers. Mr. Sweet, and some of the Continental Botanists
consider the specific name "Coccineum," which has been applied
to it, as confusing it with the plant known by that name in the
"Flora Græca," which, it is supposed, has never been introduced
into this country, it appears of much lower growth than the one now
figured, with orange flowers, and the terminal leaflet a great deal
larger. The species before us is a native of Chili, where it is called
"Quellyon" by the inhabitants, who use the root for medicinal purposes.
It is a plant of easy cultivation, growing in any common garden
soil, and is readily increased by seeds or parting the roots; introduced
into this country about the year 1826. There are only two other
species worth attention for the flower garden.</p>

<p>The unrivalled brilliancy of the colour of this beautiful species of
Verbena, renders it a most ornamental plant for the front of the flower
borders, and when grown in large patches it is almost impossible to
give an idea of the dazzling splendour of its appearance; it is a plant
of the easiest cultivation, and if allowed to grow according to its natural
habit, which is prostrate, it will propagate itself by the radicles
which are produced at the different joints, and by this means will attach
itself to the ground; the plants thus rooted may be removed any
time. A brown loamy soil, a good deal of moisture, and a sheltered
situation are necessary, and as it is doubtful how it may bear the severity
of our winters, it is the safest method to keep some plants
in a frame, during severe frosts, which will flower early in the ensuing
spring. It is a native of Paraguay and Buenos Ayres, and was introduced
into this country about 1827. There are only two other
species worth cultivating in the flower garden.</p>

<p>This is perhaps the finest and most beautiful species of Linum,
and bears the largest flowers of any of the hardy kinds. It is a very
desirable garden plant, continuing long in bloom, and forming a pleasing
variety from its glaucous foilage. It is a native of Spain, Italy, and
the south of France, and was introduced into this country about the
year 1759; though we are not aware that any figure of it has before
been given. This species may be raised from seed, which is produced in
abundance; if sown in light rich soil, and protected through the winter,
the young plants will flower the following summer, and attain the
height of eighteen inches or two feet when in perfection. It is very
hardy&mdash;this genus does not afford many ornamental species for a flower

<p>This is one of the most splendid plants which has been introduced
into this country. It is a native of Mexico, and was brought thence
by Mr. Bullock, in 1824. On its first flowering here, it was considered
a variety only of T. pavonia, but upon careful examination they
appeared to be perfectly distinct. This is satisfactorily proved by
Mr. Sweet, in his B. F. G. p. 128. The bulbs may be planted early
in the spring in light sandy soil, and placed in a green-house or frame,
as it facilitates their flowering: when the weather permits, the roots
should be taken out of the pots and put into the open air, in a warm
sheltered situation, where they will make a brilliant appearance for a
considerable time&mdash;when they have done flowering, the roots require
to be taken up and kept dry during the winter. The only species
with which we are yet acquainted, besides the one figured, is T.
pavonia.</p>

<p>There cannot be a greater ornament to the flower garden in
the autumnal months than the C. byzantinum, which is the finest
species of the genus. We learn from the Bot. Mag. that, in 1598,
bulbs of this plant were received by Clusius, at Vienna, from Constantinople,
but it was not until 1629 that it was introduced into this
country. It is a native of the Levant, and is perfectly hardy, not
requiring any particular mode of treatment, except being planted in
a light soil, mixed with bog. The flowers appear about September,
but the leaves, which are the largest of any of the species, do not
arrive at maturity until the following spring. The C. autumnale is
famed for its medicinal properties. This is not a numerous genus; the
most desirable species are</p>

<p>This is perhaps one of the most desirable species of the genus
Helianthus, from the brilliancy of the colour and its moderate growth.
It makes a striking appearance when planted at the back of the flower
borders, and will continue in beauty to a late period in the autumn.
According to Pursh it is found in the "western parts of Pennsylvania,"
and was introduced into this country in 1732. It will grow well in
any good garden soil, and may be increased by parting the roots.
There are not many species of this genus suitable for a flower garden,
as they grow to such a large size, and take up so much room: the

exceed in beauty the one here figured, which possesses a peculiar
attraction from its flowers being most beautiful when in a state of
decay. According to the Bot. Mag. p. 2682, it was "raised from
seeds received by Mr. Barclay, from Bogota, in Columbia, and communicated
in flower in August 1826." There is no doubt it will soon
be generally cultivated, as it bears seeds in abundance, which may be
sown in good rich soil in the open ground, and the plants thus reared
will flower abundantly during the summer months, and continue in
beauty till destroyed by frost. It is yet uncertain whether this species
be more than annual. Amongst the finest of this genus are</p>

<p>It is almost impossible to give an adequate representation of the
brilliant colour of this beautiful species of Gladiolus, which was introduced
into this country from Holland, about the year 1789, by the
gardener to the King of Naples: though generally considered a tender
plant, it will be found to grow well out of doors, in a southern aspect
and sheltered situation, only requiring protection in the winter to keep
the roots from severe frosts. Many of the bulbs from the Cape of
Good Hope, of which place this is a native, may be grown well with
care and attention in the open air, and make a beautiful addition to
the flower garden in the summer months. The bulbs should be planted
six or eight inches deep in a rich sandy soil, in a south aspect, where
they will grow strong and flower freely. The hardiest species are</p>

<p>Though this plant is frequently confused with C. tuberosa it is
proved to be decidedly distinct, Mr. Sweet having obligingly informed
the author that he has carefully compared the two species, and thus confirmed
the opinions of Rœmer et Schultz, and other botanists on the
Continent, where the distinction is now generally adopted. This species,
which has a larger and lighter coloured flower, longer and narrower
leaves, than C. tuberosa, is a native of Mexico, and was introduced into
this country in 1813: it has been generally treated as a green-house
plant, but it will grow perfectly well in the open air, though from the
fleshy nature of the roots it is necessary to take them up in winter, and
treat them in the same manner as Dahlias. C. crassifolia is the only
species besides the two above mentioned, suitable for the flower garden.</p>

<p>This plant, formerly known as Amaryllis lutea, is a native of
the South of Europe, and various parts of the East. Though introduced
into this country as early as 1596, it is by no means common.
When planted in the front of the borders it is very ornamental, particularly
when exposed to a bright sun, which causes the flowers to expand.
It has acquired a more interesting character, from the supposition
entertained by the late Sir J. E. Smith, that it may possibly be
the Lily of Scripture, to which we find such beautiful allusions in the
Sacred writings. Sir J. E. S. observes, "It is natural to presume the
Divine Teacher, according to his usual custom, called the attention of his
hearers to some object at hand; and, as the fields of the Levant are overrun
with the Amaryllis lutea, whose golden liliaceous flowers in Autumn
afford one of the most brilliant and gorgeous objects in nature, the expression
of 'Solomon, in all his glory, not being arrayed like one of
these,' is peculiarly appropriate." It is a plant of easy cultivation,
perfectly hardy, and will grow in any good garden soil. At present
there are few species of this genus.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
