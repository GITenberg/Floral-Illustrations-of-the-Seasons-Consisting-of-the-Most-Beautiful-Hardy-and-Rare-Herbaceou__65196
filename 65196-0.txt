TO WILLIAM ROSCOE, ESQ., F. L. S.,

_&c. &c. &c._


  MY DEAR SIR,

In dedicating this Work to you, I am not presumptuous enough to believe
that I can offer anything novel in a botanical point of view, though
I am sure you are too generous a patron of the science to discourage
any effort, however feeble, which has for its object the diffusion
of a taste for such pursuits: my motives, however, are not of this
nature; I would offer it to you as a mark of respect and affection, but
more particularly of gratitude, for the warm attachment you have ever
evinced towards me, which has contributed so much to the happiness of
my life. With these sentiments, allow me to subscribe myself,

  Your affectionate Daughter,

  M. R.

  TOXTETH PARK,
  _March, 1829_.




PREFACE.


The present state of botanical knowledge renders it impossible for the
Author of this Work to indulge in a hope, that she can add anything to
the learning and research which distinguish the science: as a humble
follower of those who have added so much to our information on these
subjects, she would walk in their delightful paths, and gather some of
those objects of beauty which lie scattered around her. To endeavour to
place them in an attractive form--to attach to them useful and accurate
information--has been her pleasing task; and she will be amply rewarded
if she should be the means of affording any encouragement, particularly
among her own sex, to a taste for botanical pursuits. One of our
greatest philosophers has declared a "Garden to be among the purest of
human pleasures"; and if we look for a still higher sanction--we have
the divine command to

  "Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow."

There is no pursuit which fills the mind with more noble and exalted
sentiments than the study of these works of Nature:--wherever we turn
our attention, we shall discover in them ample lessons of instruction
and delight; in the structure of every plant, we shall find the most
exact symmetry, and the most perfect contrivance--and the more minutely
we examine, the more decided traces we discern of that Power

  "Who planned, and built, and still upholds a world
  So clothed with beauty."

The gratification to be derived from such pursuits, is heightened by
considerations like these, and their utility and value are rendered
still more evident. To use the language of the late excellent and
distinguished SIR JAMES E. SMITH, "Is it not desirable to call the soul
from the feverish agitation of worldly pursuits, to the contemplation
of divine wisdom in the beautiful economy of Nature? Is it not a
privilege to walk with God in the garden of creation, and hold converse
with his providence? If such elevated feelings do not lead to the
study of Nature, it cannot be far pursued without rewarding the student
by exciting them."

In the arrangement of this Work, the Author has aimed at some degree
of novelty in the design, as well as of utility in the information. To
her own sex, to whose particular notice she offers it, she trusts it
may prove a useful and correct guide to their tastes, both in their
selection for a flower garden, and as objects for their pencil. She
has chosen those plants most remarkable for their beauty, and general
adaptation to our borders--and, in order to render the Work more
complete, she has added to every genus those species most desirable for
cultivation.

The Author cannot conclude, without expressing her obligations for the
assistance afforded her by her friend MR. SHEPHERD, Curator of the
Botanic Garden, Liverpool; and her thanks are particularly due to his
able and intelligent coadjutor, MR. HENRY SHEPHERD, F.L.S.

SPRING.


      "------------------Bright with dew,
  And in a mingled wilderness of flowers,
  Fair-handed Spring unbosoms every grace;
  With hues on hues expression cannot paint
  The breath of Nature, and her endless bloom."

Syn. _Curt. Bot. Mag._, _p._ 1111.

Crocus langeæflorus. _Salisbury Par. Lon._ _vol._ ii., _tab._ 106.

 Bulb small--leaves numerous, radical, linear, lanceolate--flower
 enclosed with the leaves in a membranous sheath---corolla yellow,
 divided into six oval-shaped petals, the three outer divisions
 beautifully marked with green--stamens three--filaments short--anthers
 sagittate--style one--stigma divided into three parts.


The species here figured is the earliest and best known in our gardens.
It was introduced into this country in the year 1629, and derives its
specific denomination from the ancient name of that part of Europe
where it abounds in a wild state. Numerous varieties of the genus are
constantly raised from seed, but the number of distinct species do not
exceed ten or twelve. The cultivation of these plants is attended with
no difficulty whatever: they will grow in any soil or situation; and
the C. mæsiacus increases so rapidly as to require frequent parting.
The different varieties make a beautiful display in the months of
February and March, if placed in alternate patches in the flower
border, and produce a brilliant effect when expanded by the warmth
of the sun. The most desirable for a flower garden are the following
species and their varieties:--

  Crocus vernus.
  ----   versicolor.
  ----   nudiflorus.
  ----   biflorus.
  Crocus susianus.
  ----   sulphureus.
  ----   sativus.
  ----   autumnalis.

HEPATICA triloba.

_Common Blue Hepatica._


_Class and Order._--POLYANDRIA POLYGYNIA.

Syn. Hepatica triloba. _Pursh, N. A. F._, _vol._ ii., _p._ 391.

 Root fibrous--leaves radical, three-lobed, on long petioles--stem
 simple, erect, pubescent--one-flowered calyx of three leaves--corolla
 blue--six petals, oval-shaped--stamens numerous, fixed to the
 receptacle--styles many--stigmas obtuse.


The blue variety of the Hepatica triloba, which blooms about March,
is one of our most beautiful Spring flowers, and is more readily
cultivated than any of the other kinds. According to Pursh, "It is a
native of Canada, and is found in woods, and on the sides of fertile
and rocky hills." The double variety of this plant is less common in
our gardens, and the single white variety is rare. These plants like
a loamy soil, and eastern exposure--and should be removed when they
are in blossom. The roots do not bear to be often separated; and if
divided into small pieces are frequently lost: but if left undisturbed
in a congenial situation, they will attain great luxuriance. Miller
says the single varieties are easily propagated by seed; but our more
modern gardeners do not coincide in this opinion. The new leaves do
not appear until after the flowers, though occasionally those of the
preceding year retain their freshness, as in the figure here given. All
the Hepaticas are ornamental.

SCILLA bifolia.

_Two-leaved Squill._


_Class and Order._--HEXANDRIA MONOGYNIA.

Syn. Scilla bifolia. _Eng. Fl._, _vol._ ii., _p._ 146.

 Bulb oblong, oval--leaves two, radical, opposite, linear, lanceolate,
 about five or six inches long--peduncles short--corolla bright
 blue--petals six, oblong, spreading in the form of a star--stamens
 six, shorter than the petals--germen superior--styles short.


This beautiful plant is a native of the West of England, though rarely
found. It likes a light soil, and should be grown in large patches,
when it forms one of the greatest ornaments to our gardens in the month
of March. The white variety also flowers about the same time, and forms
a striking and beautiful contrast if placed alternately in the flower
border. It is increased by offsets, which may be removed when the
leaves decay. If this plant be covered with a hand-glass, when coming
into bloom, it will expand more fully, and preserve the brilliancy
of its colour. The Scilla maritima possesses peculiar medicinal
properties. The most beautiful species are

  Scilla amæna.
  ----   Siberica.
  ----   Verna.
  ----   Italica
  ----   Peruviana.
  ----   præcox.

_Spanish Daffodil._


_Class and Order._--HEXANDRIA MONOGYNIA.

Syn. Narcissus Moschatus. _Curt. Bot. Mag._, _p._ 1300.

 Root bulbous--leaves radical, linear--twisted, glaucous--stem simple,
 erect--flowers solitary, issuing from a sheath, lanceolate--corolla
 cream colour, consisting of a tubular nectary, with a laciniated
 mouth, surrounded by six long tortuose petals--stamens six--pistil
 one, enclosed in the tube.


This plant is one of the least common and most beautiful of the genus,
and is remarkable for the peculiar delicacy of its colour. It is a
native of Spain, and was introduced into this country about the year
1759. It requires a light rich soil; and, like all other bulbs, ought
only to be removed when the leaves decay. The plant grows from twelve
to sixteen inches high, and flowers in April. The genus Narcissus is a
very numerous and beautiful one, and affords a delightful variety. Some
of the most ornamental are

  N. bulbocodium.
  -- poeticus.
  -- angustifolius.
  -- biflorus.
  -- odorus.
  -- tenuior.
  -- triandrus.
  -- tenuifolius.
  -- incomparibilis.
  -- bicolor.

ERYTHRONIUM dens canis.

_Common Dog's-tooth Violet._


_Class and Order._--HEXANDRIA MONOGYNIA.

Syn. Erythronium dens canis. _Curt. Bot. Mag._, _p._ 5.

 Root bulbous, oblong--leaves radical, broad, lanceolate, somewhat
 undulate, marked with brown--stem naked, erect--flowers solitary,
 drooping--corolla campanulate, composed of six equal oval-shaped
 petals, of a lilac hue, inclining to pink--stamens six, terminated
 by oblong purple anthers--germen superior--style longer than the
 stamens--stigma divided into three parts. When the flowers are fully
 expanded the petals are reflexed. The white variety differs only in
 the colour of the flower.


There are few plants more desirable for a flower garden than the
Erythronium dens canis, and its white variety; and none contribute
more to the beauty of our borders in the month of March, or beginning
of April. It is a native of Hungary, and some parts of Italy, and was
introduced into this country in the year 1596. These plants like a
light soil, mixed with bog, and are propagated by offsets, which may
be removed any time after the leaves decay; but the roots should not
be kept long out of the ground, as they are liable to shrink. Miller
mentions two species of the lilac Erythronium; but his distinctions,
founded only on the breadth of the leaves, and colour of the flower,
would not be sufficient to form a different species. It is, however,
worthy of remark, that the leaves of those bulbs which do not bear
flowers, are broader and rounder than the others. There are two other
species, mentioned by Pursh, in his "Flora of North America," vol. i.
p. 230, both bearing yellow flowers, one of which is occasionally seen
in our gardens.--Erythronium Americanum.

_Class and Order._--POLYANDRIA POLYGYNIA.

Syn. Adonis vernalis. _Curt. Bot. Mag._, _p._ 134.

 Root fibrous--stem branching, growing to the height of ten or
 twelve inches--leaves pinnate, pinnatified--calyx five segments,
 deciduous--flowers terminal--corolla yellow, composed of twelve or
 fourteen oval-shaped petals--stamens numerous--styles many--germen
 superior.


Though this plant has been long known in our gardens, having been
introduced in the year 1629, it is by no means common. It is found wild
on the mountains of Switzerland, and in different parts of Austria. It
likes a rich loamy soil, and is increased by parting the roots; but to
have it in perfection it should be grown in large patches, and seldom
divided, when it makes a beautiful appearance in the flower garden in
the months of March or April. In its native country, this plant does
not exceed four inches in height, and the flowers are of a much more
brilliant colour. There are two other species of Adonis, but they are
seldom met with.

_Auricula._


_Class and Order._--PENTANDRIA MONOGYNIA.

Syn. Primula auricula. _Jacquin Flo. Aus._ 5, _t._ 415?

 Root fibrous--leaves radical, ovate, dentate--base entire--stem
 simple, radical--flower terminal, corymbose--calyx five
 segments--corolla monopetalous, cream colour, slightly tinged with
 yellow, five segments, emarginate--stamens five--pistil one.


This plant is a native of Switzerland, and was introduced into this
country about the year 1596. It is the parent of all the beautiful
varieties of Auricula, which are now cultivated in our gardens. It
grows low, and, like many of the genus, is suitable and ornamental for
rock work. The Primulas flourish most in a mixture of loam, decayed
leaves, and bog earth, and, like all Alpine plants, require a pure
atmosphere. The leaves of this species are apt to vary in form, the
margins occasionally being entire. Some of the most beautiful are the
following:--

  Primula nivalis.
  ----    cortusoides.
  ----    helvetica.
  ----    decora.
  ----    integrifolia.
  ----    marginata.
  ----    villosa.
  ----    farinosa.
  ----    Scotica.
  ----    Pallasii.
  ----    minima.

SANGUINARIA grandiflora.

_Large-flowered Bloodwort._


_Class and Order._--POLYANDRIA MONOGYNIA.

Syn. _Lyon's MSS._

 Root tuberous, knobbed--leaves radical, lobed--lobes laciniated,
 light green, under surface reddish purple--veins red--enclosing
 the infant blossom, which gradually emerges from its folds--flower
 stem simple, erect, about six or eight inches in height--calyx two
 segments, convex, deciduous--corolla white--petals eight, oblong,
 obtuse--stamens many--style very short--germen superior, terminated by
 a stigma divided into two parts.


This beautiful species, which is much larger than the Sanguinaria
Canadensis, was introduced into this country about the year 1812, by
the late Mr. John Lyon, with several other valuable plants, collected
by him in different parts of North America. It takes its name from
the root, which, when broken, emits a red juice resembling blood,
with which the Indians are said to paint themselves. Its blossoms are
transient, and, like many other Spring flowers, require the warmth
of the sun to expand them. It grows best in bog soil and a sheltered
situation, and may be increased by parting its roots, which should
be done in the Autumn, to prevent any check to its flowering in the
following March or April. There is only another species, the S.
Canadensis, above alluded to.

 Root tuberous--stem erect, branching, growing to the height of
 one foot, or more--leaves numerous, biternate, linear--calyx five
 segments--flowers terminal--corolla deep scarlet--eight petals,
 orbicular, undulate--stamens many--anthers bright yellow--styles
 three--germen superior.


Though this beautiful plant has been so long known in our gardens,
being introduced in the year 1756, it seldom grows luxuriantly, which
perhaps may be accounted for by the liability of the roots to decay in
cold wet soils. It is a native of Siberia, flowers in May, and makes a
brilliant appearance when grown in large patches. The Pæonias grow best
in a rich loamy soil, and may be increased by parting the roots, or by
seed; by the latter means several most beautiful varieties have been
raised of the Pæonia moutan, of which a full account may be seen in the
"Hor. Soc. Trans.," vol. 6. This is a remarkably handsome genus. Some
of the most ornamental are

  P. odorata.
  -- sibirica.
  -- albiflora.
  -- Sabinii.
  -- peregrina.
  -- rosea.
  -- moutan.

 five segments, linear, acute--corolla monopetalous--five segments,
 emarginate, narrower at the base--pale blue--stamens five--style
 one--stigma divided into three parts.


The genus Phlox is perhaps one of the most beautiful cultivated in
our gardens, and affords a delightful variety, its different species
flowering all through the Summer and Autumn. The plant here figured
is the earliest; and though it cannot boast of brilliancy, it is
remarkable for the beautiful delicacy of its colour, and modest
appearance. It grows low, seldom exceeding eight or ten inches in
height, and is, on this account, very suitable for rock work. It
flowers in May, likes a strong loamy soil, and is increased by parting
the roots, or by cuttings. This species is a native of the mountains of
Virginia, North America, and was brought into this country by the late
Mr. Fraser. There are various others equally desirable for a flower
garden. Amongst the most beautiful are

  P. pyramidalis.
  -- ovata.
  -- carnea.
  -- nivalis.
  -- setacea.
  -- subulata.
  -- reflexa.
  -- amæma.

 radical, clothed with a ferruginous hair--flower issuing from an
 involucrum, sessile, trifid--corolla yellow--petals about twelve,
 oblong, obtuse--stamens numerous--styles many--germen superior.


This is a most striking and ornamental species, and though it is said
to have been introduced so far back as the year 1597, is still rare in
our gardens. It is difficult to cultivate, perhaps requiring a little
stronger soil than Anemonies generally do. When its roots have attained
a great size, it should be removed or divided, as it is then liable to
decay; few, however, are fortunate enough to cultivate it to such a
state of luxuriance. It is perfectly hardy, though mostly treated as a
frame plant. The under side of the lower radical leaves is tinged with
a bright violet colour. The genus Anemone is a numerous one, and can
boast of many ornamental species.

Syn. Pulmonaria paniculata. _Curt. Bot. Mag._, _pl._ 2680.

 Root tuberous--stem branched, one to two feet high--leaves ovate,
 oblong, acuminate, strongly nerved--panicles leafy--flowers
 drooping--calyx five segments--corolla funnel-shaped, contracted near
 the base--when arrived at maturity, of a brilliant blue--stamens
 five--style equal with the stamens--stigma obtuse--plant hispid.


This beautiful plant, according to the "Bot. Mag.," 2680, is a native
of Hudson's Bay, and was "Originally introduced to the Kew Gardens by
the late Dr. Solander, in 1778." It is still rare, and difficult to
cultivate, though in congenial situations it will sow its seed, and
increase abundantly; but the general method of propagating it is by
parting the roots. The plant from which the annexed drawing was made
grows luxuriantly in a cold, stiff soil, and has endured our severest
winters without protection. It flowers in June; and though each blossom
falls off almost as soon as it becomes perfect, there is a succession
for a considerable time. The most beautiful species of this genus are--

  P. virginica.
  -- davurica.

 Root fibrous--plant from two to three inches high--stem slender,
 radical, leafy, one-flowered--leaves very small, ovate, crenate,
 sessile, opposite--flowers terminal, drooping--calyx five
 segments--corolla purple, monopetalous, campanulate--margin five
 cleft--stamens five--style longer than the stamens--stigma divided
 into three parts--germen inferior.


This lovely little plant is a native of the mountains of Austria and
Styria, and is particularly ornamental for rock work, to which it is
well adapted by its low growth and general habit. It was introduced
into this country about the year 1779, but is still very seldom met
with. It is hardy, though like many Alpine plants is liable to be lost
in the Winter unless protected, and it is therefore the safest plan
either to keep it in a frame, or to cover it with dry leaves and a

 Root biennial? spindle-shaped--leaves radical, lyrate, dentate,
 smooth, middle rib strong--flower radical, rising from amongst the
 bright green leaves--calyx tubular--four segments, lanceolate,

 undulate--stamens eight--filaments shorter than the petals--anthers
 oblong, bright yellow--style a little longer than the stamens--stigma
 four-cleft--capsule radical, sessile, containing four cells.


The specific name of this very interesting plant was given by Professor
Nuttal, in consequence of what he considered the three-lobed form
of its petals; this is however so very slight as to be scarcely
observable, and therefore perhaps ought not to be considered a
specific distinction. It was discovered by the Professor in the
Arkansas country, in 1819, and seeds were afterwards brought by that
indefatigable traveller and naturalist, Mr. D. Douglas, from North
America, in 1824. This plant, which has a succession of flowers
throughout the Summer, is extremely liable to decay, if not kept dry in
the Winter; but it may be raised from seed, or by parting the roots in
Autumn, and keeping them in a frame, in pots of light dry soil, giving
them very little or no water until the roots begin to shoot in the
Spring. This is the best method of increasing the Œ. cespitosa, a most
lovely plant, but extremely difficult to propagate. There are numerous
species and varieties of this very interesting genus: some of the most
beautiful are--

  Œ. frutiosa.
  -- speciosa.
  -- acaulis.
  -- rosea.
  -- pallida.
  -- glauca.
  -- grandiflora.
  -- amæna.

 Plant annual--stem erect, branching--leaves linear, lanceolate,
 sessile, smooth--peduncles short--flowers growing from the axils of
 the leaves, solitary--calyx one segment, lanceolate, keeled--corolla
 beautiful purple pink--petals four, trilobed, obtuse, horned at
 the base--stamens four--anthers involute--style longer than the
 stamens--stigma divided into four parts--capsule oblong, grooved.


This very beautiful and singular annual was named by Pursh, in honour
of Captain Clark, the companion of Captain Lewis, whose interesting
travels across the continent of North America are so well known. It
was found by Mr. Douglas, in the countries around the Columbia river,
and brought by him into this country, to the Horticultural Society.
The plant is hardy; but to facilitate its bloom, the seeds should be
sown in a hotbed early in the Spring, and when the plants have acquired
sufficient strength they may be removed to the borders, where they will
continue to flower until destroyed by frost. This is the only species
known of this genus.

For this beautiful species of Potentilla we are indebted to the
celebrated Dr. Wallich, of the Botanic Garden, Calcutta, who discovered
it in Nipal, and sent seeds of it to this country. It is now becoming
generally known, and is a great acquisition to our gardens, both for
the beauty of its flower and continuing so long in blossom. A light
loam suits it best; and when it likes the situation it will sow itself,
and is therefore easily propagated. The genus Potentilla is not a showy
one, but there are several pretty species:--

  P. atrosanguinea.
  -- clusiana.
  -- hirta.
  -- lupinaster.
  -- nivea.
  -- pedata.

 terminal, on long peduncles--Calyx formed like the Calyptra of a
 Moss, which falls off previous to the expansion of the flower--petals

 in the centre of the flower--stamens numerous, filaments very short,
 anthers long, acute--stigmas four--seed vessel subulate.

This elegant flower was originally discovered by Mr. Menzies, during
the expedition of Vancouver, in the year 1792, on the coast of
California. It has been named by Chamisso after Dr. Eschscholtz, a
companion of Kotzebue, in his voyage round the world, and was sent to
the Hort. Soc., by Mr. Douglas, in 1826, who found it on the N. W.
coast of America. It promises to be a very desirable and beautiful
addition to our catalogue of herbaceous plants, flowering abundantly
all thro' the summer 'till destroyed by frost. It may be propagated
either by seeds, which should be sown in a hot-bed early in the spring,
or by parting the roots in autumn, and grows best in a pure air, and a
light, or sandy soil.

 of the leaf downy, and strongly nerved--Cauline leaves, sessile,
 linear, acute. Flowers terminal on very long peduncles on which
 are scattered membranaceous bracteas--Calyx imbricate, squamose,
 membranaceous, striate--Corolla blue--Florets ligulate, apex
 three toothed, purple at the base, fertile--Stamens five, Anthers
 united--style one, stigma bifid.


There are only two species known of this genus, the one here figured is
a native of the South of Europe, and is said to have been cultivated
by Parkinson as far back as the year 1640, it is however by no means
a common plant, owing perhaps to the difficulty of keeping it through
the winter, when it is very apt to be destroyed by frost; it is easily
raised from seeds which may be sown in the autumn, and if protected
during the winter, will make strong plants to flower through the
ensuing summer, continuing in beauty until the approach of winter--it
likes a dry, sandy soil, and will not bear frequent removal,--the other
species, Catananche lutea, is an annual not deserving of cultivation.

 Root fibrous, creeping--Stem, tall, erect, branched. Leaves on
 short petioles ternate, leaflets lanceolate, acute--cauline leaves
 becoming more linear. Flowers large, terminal, on long, slender
 peduncles--Calyx double, exterior segments green, lanceolate acute;
 interior segments brown, membranaceous--Corolla bright yellow,
 radiated florets barren, dentate; florets of the disk fertile.


This fine species is so similar to C. Lanceolata, that it is only to be
distinguished by the leaf, the flowers being alike in form and color,
though perhaps a little larger in C. grandiflora--it was found by
Professor Nuttall in the Arkansas, and was sent by him to Mr. Barclay
about the year 1826; it is therefore from its late introduction yet
rare in our collections, it promises to be of easy cultivation, its
creeping roots throwing up a plentiful supply of young plants from
which it may easily be propagated--a little protection in the winter
may perhaps be desirable.

  C. lanceolata

 Root tuberous--stem upright, branched, growing from three to five
 feet high. Leaves pinnate, lower leaves sometimes bi-pinnate,
 leaflets serrate--flowers terminal, on long purple peduncles--calyx
 double, exterior segments somewhat reflexed, obtuse--corolla bright
 scarlet--radiated florets ovate, obtuse, furnished with a style
 only--florets of the disk, containing both stamens and pistils.


This distinct species, which is perhaps one of the most beautiful of
the genus is readily distinguished by its small flower and foliage--it
is a native of Mexico, and previous to its introduction to this
country, by Mr. Fraser, in 1803, was cultivated in France,--endless
varieties of this genus are constantly raised from seed, and by other
means, and there is no flower to which we are so much indebted for
ornamenting our gardens in the Autumn--the cultivation of this plant
is so easy, and now so well known that little requires to be said on
this point. Particular care, however, must be taken to keep the roots
from frost; a poor soil will cause a smaller growth, and produce more
flowers. The name Georgina was given to this genus by Wildenow, in
honor of G. Georgi, a Russian Botanist, and as it is considered by the
Continental and many English Botanists, to be the most correct, it has
been here adopted, instead of Dahlia, a name very similar to that of
another genus (Dalea) called after Dale the friend of Ray;[1] some of
the most beautiful double Georginas are varieties of the Sambucifolia.

The genus Rudbeckia (called after Professor Rudbeck of Upsal who
died in 1702) is a very ornamental one, its different species making
a gay appearance in the Autumn. R. hirta is perhaps one of the most
desirable, from its moderate size, seldom growing higher than two
feet--it was introduced about the year 1714, it is a native of N.
America, and is found on the mountains from Virginia to Florida--it
likes a light rich soil, and is propagated by parting the roots,
which should be done in the spring, as it flowers so late in Autumn
as to prevent the removal in sufficient time for the plants to be
well established before winter--it is rather tender, sometimes being
destroyed by too much wet. The following are pleasing species:--

  R. purpurea.
  -- fulgida.
  -- columnaris.
  -- speciosa.
  -- pinnata.

 lanceolate, acute--corolla delicate purple, segments trilobed, lobes
 obtuse, margins undulate, florets of the disk tubular, margins
 five-cleft--Calyx double--stamens four, anthers oblong, of a bright
 red, style longer than the stamens; stigma globose; germen downy.


This is perhaps the most beautiful species of the genus; and a highly
ornamental plant in the Autumnal months, during which time it continues
long in beauty, it is a native of Mount Caucasus, and according to the
Bot. Mag. p. 886, was raised by Messrs. Loddiges from seeds received
by them about the year 1803--a light soil suits it best, and it may be
increased by parting its roots in the spring--it is quite hardy.

The genus Scabiosa is not a favorite one for a flower garden, though a
few species may deserve a place in our collections--some of the most
desirable are

  S. alpina.

  -- atropurpurea.

 Root fibrous--stem erect, leafy, occasionally drooping at the
 summit, downy. Leaves alternate sessile, broad lanceolate, undulate,
 denticulate near the point, veined, becoming smaller towards the
 top of the stem--peduncles very short--calyx five segments, acute,
 downy--corolla monopetalous, very brilliant scarlet--tube oblong,
 inflated at the base, segments five, three lower ones, oblong,
 lanceolate, acute; two upper, small, linear, acute, recurved--stamens
 five--anthers oblong, style filiform--stigma compressed.


This brilliant ornament to the flower garden is a native of Mexico,
and was raised from seeds sent by Humboldt and Bonpland, to this
country, about the year 1809--it is a plant of easy cultivation, and
is readily increased by parting the roots in Spring--it is hardy, but
in the winter requires to be kept dry, as it is liable to decay from
too much moisture, it is therefore the safest plan to put a few plants
in a frame, divide them, and plant them about April, in a stiff soil,
and moist situation, where they will flourish exceedingly, and make
a splendid appearance until destroyed by frost--This species differs
little from L. Splendens, which has its foliage more tinged with red
and is devoid of that pubescence which distinguishes L. fulgens.

There are several beautiful species of this genus, but few are hardy,
those most desirable for a flower garden are

Few autumnal plants are more deserving of cultivation than the Aster
Amellus--the beauty of the flower, its moderately low growth, and late
flowering, rendering it a valuable plant for the season, and perhaps
preferable to any of the genus--it is a native of the South of Europe,
and was cultivated in this country, as long since as 1596, by Gerard,
it will grow in any soil or situation, and flowers from September until
destroyed by severe frost--it may be increased by dividing the roots,
which according to Miller should not be moved oftener than every third
year.

The first introduction of the Chinese Chrysanthemums into this country,
was about the year 1764;--the beautiful varieties now seen in our
gardens, became known at a much more recent period, and from the great
facility that attends their cultivation, and their very desirable
season of flowering, they are universal favorites;--new varieties are
frequently imported, the only means we possess of obtaining them, as
we are ignorant of the mode adopted by the Chinese for their increase;
and we are led to suppose that we do not yet possess some of their
finest kinds:--most of the varieties will grow well out of doors, and
if trained against a south wall, with a little protection to shield
the flowers from inclement weather, will make a beautiful and gay
appearance in the months of November and December. The Chrysanthemums
are increased either by cuttings or suckers taken from the parent
plant in the spring;--the var. here figured is a very beautiful one,
and blossoms rather early and freely--the flowers have a deeper color
when grown out of doors, and the plant altogether acquires more
strength;--in a green-house this var. is apt to grow weak and tall.

its long continuance in bloom, and the flowers being so very large and

 segments, white--style projecting, stigma dark purple.


This plant possesses little beauty to recommend it to our notice, but
its delightful fragrance, which strongly resembles the Heliotropium
Peruvianum, renders it an acceptable addition to our small stock of
winter flowers. It is a native of Italy, and was introduced into this
country by Messrs. Lee and Kennedy, in 1806. Though frequently treated
as a green-house or frame-plant, it is perfectly hardy, and if grown in
a moist situation, it will spread so rapidly as to become troublesome;
the best plan therefore is to confine it in a pot, and plunge it in
common garden soil, where it will flower about December or January,
without the least protection.

This is the only species suitable for a flower garden.

There are few flowers more welcome to us than the Helleborus
niger, which enlivens our gardens in the dreary months of December
and January. It is a native of the mountains of Austria, and was
introduced into this country about the year 1596, by Mr. John Gerard;
it derives its name from the dark color of its roots, and the common
appellation of the Christmas Rose, arises from the peculiar season of
its flowering; being an alpine plant it delights in a pure air, and
it grows best in a moist situation and strong loamy soil: it may be
covered with a hand-glass when coming into bloom, as the beauty of
the flower is liable to be destroyed by the severity of the weather.
Considerable medicinal properties were ascribed to this plant by the
ancients, but it is now seldom used. There are several other species,
but only two of these are generally cultivated--the first mentioned is
a British plant.

Helleborus hyemalis. _Curt. Bot. Mag._ _Vol._ 1. _p._ 3.

 Root tuberous--leaves radical, on long petioles, radiated, palmate,
 lobes generally trifid--scape radical, one flowered--involucrum
 sessile, lobed, becoming larger when the flower decays--corolla
 yellow--petals six, or sometimes more, obovate, nectaries tubular,
 stamens from twenty to thirty--anthers compressed--styles many.


The genus Eranthis, which was established by Salisbury, differs from
Helleborus in the number of its petals and stamens, the latter in
Eranthis are from twenty to thirty, in Helleborus, from thirty to
sixty; the seed in the former genus being in one series, the latter
in two series, the difference of habit, &c., altogether forming good
grounds for making them separate genera. This pretty species which
flowers about January is a native of France, Switzerland, and Austria,
and was cultivated in our gardens as long since as 1596;--it grows best
in a light loam mixed with bog, and is propagated by offsets. There is
another species Eranthis Siberica.

 Root fibrous--stem branching upon the ground, leaves small, linear,
 sessile--flowers pendulous, on very short peduncles--calyx four
 segments, linear acute--corolla campanulate, pale pink, margin
 four cleft--stamens eight fixed to the receptacle, anthers bifid,
 projecting, dark purple--style declining, longer than the stamens.


This pretty little plant would be acceptable to us at any season of the
year, but is peculiarly so in the dreary one in which its beautiful
pink blossoms appear, frequently peeping above the snow. The flowers
are formed in the autumn, but do not come to maturity until the
following December or January, when (if planted in a bog border with a
south aspect) it will make a beautiful appearance for a length of time.
It is a native of the Alps and mountainous parts of Germany, and was
introduced into this country about the year 1763; the general method
of increasing this plant is by cuttings or layers,--there are other
species of hardy heaths which are well worth cultivating. The three
last mentioned are natives of Britain.

 three emarginate, beautifully tipped with green--stamens six, anthers
 subulate--style one, stigma simple.


This beautiful flower so well known, and so peculiarly interesting from
its modest simplicity, hardly requires a description of its treatment
or mode of growth. It is a native of England, having been found in
many places remote from cultivation, and will grow in any soil or
situation.--A double var. is frequently met with in our gardens, there
is also another species G. plicatus, a native of Caucasus.

 Root bulbous, orbicular, compressed. Leaves radical, on rather long
 purplish petioles, orbicular, cordate, upper side dark green, red
 underneath--stem radical, three or four inches high, flower terminal,
 drooping--calyx five segments acute--petals five, reflexed, ovate,
 margins undulate, dark pink, marked with red at the base, which is
 shaded off to a pure white, stamens five enclosed in the tube of the
 corolla, style longer than the stamens, stigma acute.


This pretty plant which is one of the earliest of our Spring bulbs,
is a native of the south of Europe, and has been known since the year
1596, when it was cultivated by Mr. John Gerard. It is very hardy,
though generally treated as a green-house or frame plant, and if grown
in a sheltered situation in a mixture of bog earth, and rich loam, it
will flower abundantly, and make a beautiful appearance about February,
particularly if covered with a hand-glass to protect the flowers from
the inclemency of the weather.

This plant is easily raised from seed, which is produced in abundance.
After the petals decay the germen becomes enlarged, and the foot stalk
enclosing it in the centre, twists in the form of a screw, until it
reaches the ground, when the seed-vessel bursts and deposits the seed,
a beautiful provision of nature for propagating the species--the seeds
thus sown, will require a little more soil, and the protection of a
hand-glass during the Winter, when if not destroyed by frost, the
plants will generally flower the following Summer--the other hardy
species are

  C. hederæfolium.

 margins undulate, of a dull green, strongly veined with red--under
 side reddish in the young leaves--flowers thyrsiform--on short
 pedicels--calyx campanulate, margin five cleft, segments acute,
 tinged with purple--corolla lilac, funnel shaped, limb spreading,
 five cleft--stamens five, inclined, shorter than the style--stigma
 clavate--whole plant covered with a whitish pubescence which it nearly
 loses in more advanced growth.


The genus Hyoscyamus is, perhaps, more remarkable for its medicinal
properties than for its beauty, though this species is certainly a
handsome plant and as yet rarely met with:--it is of later introduction
than Hyoscyamus Physaloides, which has a darker flower, the leaves
perfectly smooth, and the plant altogether is of smaller growth. H.
Orientalis is a native of Iberia, a country between the Black and
Caspian Seas, and was first introduced into this country from seeds
sent to Mr. John Hunneman, about the year 1821; it is perfectly hardy,
likes a rich soil, and may be increased by parting the roots or by
seed; flowers as early as March. There is only another species besides
the two mentioned, deserving of cultivation in a flower garden, which
is H. Scopoli.

The Orobus vernus is a most valuable Spring flower, and is one of the
earliest of our herbaceous plants;--it is a native of the middle and
south of Europe, and was first introduced into this country about the
year 1629;--a light soil suits it best, though being very hardy it will
flourish in any situation, and considering the facility with which it
is cultivated, it is surprizing it is not more common;--it flowers in
March, and is increased by dividing the roots or by seed--some of the
most desirable species are

 at the base of each petal.


The genus Uvularia is neither a numerous, nor a showy one, though the
species figured (which is the finest) is a very elegant plant, and if
placed in the front of a bog border, the soil of which is peculiarly
adapted to it, will add much to the beauty of the flower garden about
April. In 1802, Messrs. Lee and Kennedy received this species from
North America, and according to Pursh, it is found on shady hills in
fertile soils, and among the rocks from Canada to Carolina;--it is
perfectly hardy, and may be increased by parting the roots early in the
Autumn.

 between the segments--stamens five, enclosed in the tube of the
 corolla--style simple, stigmas two, so closely situated as to give the
 appearance of a small white circle in the centre of the flower.


This beautiful little plant is well ascertained to be a native of
England and Ireland. According to English Botany, p. 49--it was first
gathered in Teesdale Forest, Durham, where it is still obtained for
the purposes of sale in London, and other places;--it is also a native
of the Alps of Switzerland, where we are told the large patches of it
produce a brilliant and striking effect:--it is perfectly hardy, but
requires a pure air, and succeeds best in bog-soil--from its low growth
and general habit, it is well adapted to ornament rock work, and from
the shelter there afforded, it will begin to flower as early as March,
and continue in beauty some time--it may be increased by parting the
roots early in the Autumn:--the Gentiana lutea, is celebrated for its
medicinal properties, and is a handsome herbaceous plant; the other

 Root fibrous--leaves radical, on long petioles, orbicular, cordate,
 slightly crenate, of a dark green, paler underneath--stem radical,
 erect, three or four inches high--segments of the involucrum
 linear--flowers terminal, drooping,--calyx five, segments linear,
 spreading--corolla purple, monopetalous, campanulate, margin deeply
 laciniated--stamens five, anthers two lobed--style very long, germen
 inferior.


The beautiful genus Soldanella is peculiarly adapted to rock work, to
which it is a great ornament; the different species are all hardy,
but like many alpine plants, require shelter from severe frosts, as
a substitute for the snow of their native mountains; this species is
found on the mountains of Bohemia, and on the Austrian and Styrian
Alps, and was introduced into this country about the year 1816.
It grows best in a mixture of peat and sandy loam, and is readily
increased by seeds, or by parting the roots; the genus is by no means
common, perhaps, from their requiring a very pure air to grow them in
perfection; it is the safest plan to keep all alpine plants in a frame
during winter, or to cover them with _dry_ saw dust, over which may
be placed a hand-glass or garden-pot. This species is called after
Clusius a celebrated Botanist, it being (according to the Bot. Mag. p.
211.) first described and figured by him. There are two other beautiful
species, with smaller flowers, S. alpina, S. minima.

 with a darker shade, lower part of the middle petal terminating in a
 spur--stamens five, anthers obtuse--style slender, stigma globose.


The genus Viola is a very numerous one, and can boast of many
ornamental species--endless varieties are constantly raised from seed,
chiefly of Viola tricolor, though these may at first vary, there is
little dependance to be placed on them, as they frequently return to
the original species; the number of distinct species, however, is very
considerable, amongst which is the one figured; a desirable plant
for the front of the borders where it will remain in beauty for a
long time--it is a native of North America, and according to the Bot.
Cab. p. 1471, grows on dry hills from New England to Virginia. Prof.
Nuttall says in his genera of North American plants, vol. i. p. 147,
"the genus Viola within its proper limits, is almost equally divided
betwixt Europe and the temperate parts of North America." This species
was first brought into this country in 1739, though still a scarce
plant in our gardens:--the Violas are all well adapted for rock work,
and flourish most in a light rich soil and shady situation. They may be
increased either by parting the roots, by cuttings, or by seeds; the
latter of which are produced in great abundance, and are dispersed by
the peculiar elasticity of the capsule, which as soon as its contents
are matured, ejects them with considerable force, sometimes to a great
distance. Some of the most beautiful species are

  V. pedata.

 ovate, obtuse, nerved--stamens six, filaments short, anthers oblong,
 styles three, stigmas recurved.


This is the most desirable species of the genus and a very handsome
herbaceous plant, the beautiful white flowers forming a pleasing
contrast to the dark green leaves by which they are surrounded. It is a
native of Upper Canada, and according to Nuttall, is found generally in
umbrageous forests.--a peat soil, and shady situation are essential to
its favorable cultivation, and as these are afforded, the flower varies
accordingly in size--it is a plant of slow growth, not hearing frequent
removal, and is therefore not common, though it has been known in this
country since the year 1799--flowers about April, and is increased by
parting the roots. The other species are not particularly desirable,
except in extensive herbaceous collections.

The genus Salpiglossis is one of late introduction into this country,
none of the species being known here before the year 1826, when
seeds were sent from Chili by Mr. Cruikshanks to the Botanic Gardens
of Edinburgh and Glasgow. The species figured is perhaps the most
beautiful, and promises to be a great acquisition to our collection of
new herbaceous plants, it may be raised from seeds or cuttings, likes
a light soil, and a sheltered situation, and will continue in flower
for a considerable time. It has hitherto been treated chiefly as a
green-house plant, but it will grow much stronger, and the colours
finer, in the open border; it would, however, be desirable to keep some
plants in a green-house or frame during the winter, as it is doubtful
how it may bear the severe frosts. There are only two other species,

  S. straminea.

This species of Iris, though so long since introduced as the year
1597 is not frequently seen in our herbaceous collections. It is a
plant of low growth, sometimes not exceeding a foot in height, though
this varies according to the soil in which it is planted, a moist
situation increasing its luxuriance both in flower and foliage. It
is a native of Hungary, and is perfectly hardy, not requiring any
particular treatment, and may be increased by separating the roots in
Autumn,--flowers in May, and grows best in a stiff cold soil. This is a
very beautiful genus, and affords many ornamental species.

The genus Delphinium is a beautiful and showy one, and contains almost
innumerable varieties, none, however, can exceed in beauty of colour
the species figured, which is a native of Siberia, and was introduced
into this country about the year 1741. It is a hardy plant, of the
easiest culture, not requiring any particular treatment, though
it grows best in a rich brown loam--if allowed to sow its seed, a
number of young plants will soon appear, which will flower the next
year; this mode, however, of propagating it, is by no means certain,
and therefore, in order to obtain it true, it is better to divide
the roots, which may be done in spring; numerous and very beautiful
varieties are constantly raised from seed. Amongst the most desirable

This is one of the most beautiful species of the genus Lilium. It is
rare, perhaps from the difficulty that attends its cultivation, the
bulbs being extremely liable to be lost in the winter from severe
frosts or damp; it is a native of China, and was introduced into this
country in the year 1806. A sheltered situation, and light rich soil,
mixed with bog, are necessary for it, and it is increased by off-sets,
which are produced in tolerable abundance. All the species of Lilium

 filament, with an acute claw at the base, apex hairy, style
 recurved--leaves, when young, of a beautiful purple on the under side.


Great additions have lately been made to this genus, by Mr. Douglas,
who has discovered many new and valuable plants in North America, among
which is the species figured. According to the Bot. Mag. pl. 2903, N.
S. it was found by him "growing plentifully among the limestone rocks
on the high mountains about the grand rapids of the Columbia river,
at the distance of 140 miles from the ocean," and sent to the Hort.
Soc. in 1826; it likes a light loam and sheltered situation, and may
be increased by seeds or parting the roots. When well grown it is a
very beautiful and elegant plant, and a great acquisition to the flower
garden. As we are yet scarcely aware how it may bear the cold of our
winters, it will be desirable to protect it from severe frosts. The
genus can now boast of many new and beautiful species,

 Root fibrous--radical leaves growing in a tuft, large, lobed,
 lyrate, interruptedly pinnate, terminal leaflet cordate, margin
 dentate; side leaflets numerous, sessile, becoming smaller to the
 base--cauline leaves sessile, pinnatifed--flowers stem radical,
 erect, branching--stipules ovate, acute--peduncles leafy--flowers
 terminal--calyx five segments, reflexed, acute--petals five, bright
 scarlet, nearly round, emarginate, obtuse--stamens numerous--radiated
 filaments inserted in the tube of the calyx, anthers yellow, styles
 many, germen superior--whole plant hairy.


This beautiful plant is a very valuable acquisition to our flower
borders, from the brilliancy of its colour, and affording a continued
succession of flowers. Mr. Sweet, and some of the Continental Botanists
consider the specific name "Coccineum," which has been applied to it,
as confusing it with the plant known by that name in the "Flora Græca,"
which, it is supposed, has never been introduced into this country,
it appears of much lower growth than the one now figured, with orange
flowers, and the terminal leaflet a great deal larger. The species
before us is a native of Chili, where it is called "Quellyon" by the
inhabitants, who use the root for medicinal purposes. It is a plant of
easy cultivation, growing in any common garden soil, and is readily
increased by seeds or parting the roots; introduced into this country
about the year 1826. There are only two other species worth attention
for the flower garden.

 Root fibrous, stem prostrate, branching--leaves opposite, sessile,
 oblong, ovate, margins deeply serrate, hairy on both sides--flowers
 terminal, corymbose--calyx campanulate, five cleft--corolla very
 bright crimson, tubular, limb spreading, five segments, obtuse
 emarginate--throat white, hairy--stamens four, two long, two short,
 inserted in the tube of the corolla--anthers two lobed, style one,
 smooth, stigma bifid, germen smooth.


The unrivalled brilliancy of the colour of this beautiful species of
Verbena, renders it a most ornamental plant for the front of the flower
borders, and when grown in large patches it is almost impossible to
give an idea of the dazzling splendour of its appearance; it is a plant
of the easiest cultivation, and if allowed to grow according to its
natural habit, which is prostrate, it will propagate itself by the
radicles which are produced at the different joints, and by this means
will attach itself to the ground; the plants thus rooted may be removed
any time. A brown loamy soil, a good deal of moisture, and a sheltered
situation are necessary, and as it is doubtful how it may bear the
severity of our winters, it is the safest method to keep some plants in
a frame, during severe frosts, which will flower early in the ensuing
spring. It is a native of Paraguay and Buenos Ayres, and was introduced
into this country about 1827. There are only two other species worth
cultivating in the flower garden.

  V. aubletia.

 Root fibrous,--stem branching,--leaves sessile, alternate,
 linear acute, smooth, glaucous,--flowers terminal on moderate
 peduncles,--calyx five segments, linear acute,--corolla bright blue,
 beautifully vein'd, with a darker shade,--petals five, obovate,
 margins slightly undulate,--stamens five, anthers oblong, filaments
 united at the base, surrounding the germen, which is crowned by five
 thread-like styles.


This is perhaps the finest and most beautiful species of Linum, and
bears the largest flowers of any of the hardy kinds. It is a very
desirable garden plant, continuing long in bloom, and forming a
pleasing variety from its glaucous foilage. It is a native of Spain,
Italy, and the south of France, and was introduced into this country
about the year 1759; though we are not aware that any figure of it
has before been given. This species may be raised from seed, which
is produced in abundance; if sown in light rich soil, and protected
through the winter, the young plants will flower the following
summer, and attain the height of eighteen inches or two feet when
in perfection. It is very hardy--this genus does not afford many
ornamental species for a flower garden, the most desirable are,

  L. perenne.
  -- alpina.
  -- flavum.

 Root bulbous--stem radical, angular--leaves alternate, broadly
 lanceolate, plicate, inflated at the base, dark green, two sheathing
 spathes at the base of the corolla, ovate, lanceolate--corolla
 bright orange, slightly tinted with a redder shade on the margin of
 the petals, base spotted with dark crimson--petals six, three outer
 petals broadly ovate, acute, base concave, three inner ones smaller,
 panduriform--stamens three--filaments united--anthers oblong--style
 longer than the stamens--stigma divided into three parts, each bifid.


This is one of the most splendid plants which has been introduced into
this country. It is a native of Mexico, and was brought thence by
Mr. Bullock, in 1824. On its first flowering here, it was considered
a variety only of T. pavonia, but upon careful examination they
appeared to be perfectly distinct. This is satisfactorily proved by
Mr. Sweet, in his B. F. G. p. 128. The bulbs may be planted early in
the spring in light sandy soil, and placed in a green-house or frame,
as it facilitates their flowering: when the weather permits, the roots
should be taken out of the pots and put into the open air, in a warm
sheltered situation, where they will make a brilliant appearance for a
considerable time--when they have done flowering, the roots require to
be taken up and kept dry during the winter. The only species with which
we are yet acquainted, besides the one figured, is T. pavonia.

-- Colchicum byzantinum. _Sweet's Hort. Brit._ _p._ 539.

 Root bulbous, very large--scape radical, many flowered--corolla lilac
 pink--tube long, petals six, ob-ovate, spreading, strongly nerved
 at the back of each petal, tipped with a deeper color--stamens six,
 three longer than the others--filaments inserted in the base of
 the petals--anthers bright yellow--styles three, longer than the
 stamens--leaves radical, very large, broadly lanceolate, plicate,
 smooth, appearing after the flowers decay.


There cannot be a greater ornament to the flower garden in the autumnal
months than the C. byzantinum, which is the finest species of the
genus. We learn from the Bot. Mag. that, in 1598, bulbs of this plant
were received by Clusius, at Vienna, from Constantinople, but it was
not until 1629 that it was introduced into this country. It is a native
of the Levant, and is perfectly hardy, not requiring any particular
mode of treatment, except being planted in a light soil, mixed with
bog. The flowers appear about September, but the leaves, which are
the largest of any of the species, do not arrive at maturity until
the following spring. The C. autumnale is famed for its medicinal
properties. This is not a numerous genus; the most desirable species are

  C. crociflorum.

 Root fibrous--stem tall, erect, branching--radical leaves very large,

 leaves sessile, opposite, ovate lanceolate, dentate acute--calyx
 many segments imbricate, acute--corolla dark bright yellow--radiated
 florets, barren dentate--florets of the disk fertile--whole plant
 rugose.


This is perhaps one of the most desirable species of the genus
Helianthus, from the brilliancy of the colour and its moderate growth.
It makes a striking appearance when planted at the back of the flower
borders, and will continue in beauty to a late period in the autumn.
According to Pursh it is found in the "western parts of Pennsylvania,"
and was introduced into this country in 1732. It will grow well in any
good garden soil, and may be increased by parting the roots. There are
not many species of this genus suitable for a flower garden, as they
grow to such a large size, and take up so much room: the best are

  H. mollis.

Syn. Lupinus mutabilis. _Bot. Mag._ _pl._ 2682.

-- Lupinus mutabilis. _Sweet's B. F. G._ _vol._ 2, _p._ 130.

 Root fibrous--stem suffruticose, branching, smooth--leaves on long
 petioles, digitate; leaflets (generally nine) oblong, mucronate--spike
 lateral--flowers verticillate, on short pedicels, white, changing to
 a beautiful purple as decay approaches--calyx two segments; upper
 segment erect, emarginate; lower one acute--vexillum nearly round,
 sides reflexed, yellow at the base--alæ broad obtuse--carina acute,
 enclosing the parts of fructification--stamens ten--filaments united
 at the base, concealing the germen--style a little longer than the
 stamens--stigma very small--legumen broad, margin deeply undulate,
 containing generally three white smooth seeds.


The genus Lupinus is now become very interesting, from the numerous
fine species that have lately been introduced; none can exceed in
beauty the one here figured, which possesses a peculiar attraction from
its flowers being most beautiful when in a state of decay. According
to the Bot. Mag. p. 2682, it was "raised from seeds received by Mr.
Barclay, from Bogota, in Columbia, and communicated in flower in August
1826." There is no doubt it will soon be generally cultivated, as it
bears seeds in abundance, which may be sown in good rich soil in the
open ground, and the plants thus reared will flower abundantly during
the summer months, and continue in beauty till destroyed by frost. It
is yet uncertain whether this species be more than annual. Amongst the
finest of this genus are

  L. polyphyllus.

 Root fibrous--leaves radical, clustered, on long channelled
 petioles, pinnatifid, hairy--stem radical, naked, erect when
 the flower expands, hairy--flower terminal--calyx two segments,
 concave, deciduous--corolla very pale yellow--petals four spreading,
 orbicular, margins crenate--stamens numerous, inserted into the
 receptacle--anthers dark yellow--style cylindrical--stigma stellate.


Though this species of Papaver cannot boast of brilliancy of colour, it
is nevertheless a very lovely plant from its delicacy and simplicity;
and, from the continued succession of flowers, it will be found an
ornamental plant to our gardens. According to the Hort. Kew. p. 289,
"it is a native of Norway and Siberia, and was cultivated in 1730 by
Dr. James Sherard." Numerous beautiful varieties have been raised from
seed, which make a very gay appearance all through the summer and
autumn, until checked by frost: these are quite hardy, and will grow in
any light rich soil. The most ornamental species are

  P. bracteatum.

Syn. Gladiolus Cardinalis. _Bot. Mag._ _t._ 135.

 Root bulbous--leaves radical, embracing the stem at the base,
 linear, lanceolate, striate--scape sometimes two feet in height,
 drooping, many-flowered--calyx two sheath-like segments, lanceolate,
 acute--corolla bright scarlet, monopetalous, campanulate, tube long,
 limb six segments, irregular, oblong, ovate, margins undulate; three
 smaller segments beautifully marked with a white stripe on the centre
 of each--stamens three--filaments long, inserted in the tube of the
 corolla--anthers oblong--style longer than the stamens--stigma divided
 into three parts.


It is almost impossible to give an adequate representation of the
brilliant colour of this beautiful species of Gladiolus, which was
introduced into this country from Holland, about the year 1789, by the
gardener to the King of Naples: though generally considered a tender
plant, it will be found to grow well out of doors, in a southern aspect
and sheltered situation, only requiring protection in the winter to
keep the roots from severe frosts. Many of the bulbs from the Cape of
Good Hope, of which place this is a native, may be grown well with care
and attention in the open air, and make a beautiful addition to the
flower garden in the summer months. The bulbs should be planted six or
eight inches deep in a rich sandy soil, in a south aspect, where they
will grow strong and flower freely. The hardiest species are

 Root tuberous, fasciculated, fusiform--stem erect, branching--leaves

 sheathing the stem, fringed on one side with a line of hairs--peduncle
 pubescent--flower terminal--involucrum cordate, acute, enclosing two
 or more flowers--pedicel smooth, very short--calyx three segments,
 alternate with the petals--corolla bright blue--petals three,
 equal, ovate, margins undulate--nectaries three, erect--stamens
 three--filaments recurved--anthers sagittate--style longer than the
 stamens--stigma very small.


Though this plant is frequently confused with C. tuberosa it is
proved to be decidedly distinct, Mr. Sweet having obligingly informed
the author that he has carefully compared the two species, and thus
confirmed the opinions of Rœmer et Schultz, and other botanists on
the Continent, where the distinction is now generally adopted. This
species, which has a larger and lighter coloured flower, longer and
narrower leaves, than C. tuberosa, is a native of Mexico, and was
introduced into this country in 1813: it has been generally treated
as a green-house plant, but it will grow perfectly well in the open
air, though from the fleshy nature of the roots it is necessary to
take them up in winter, and treat them in the same manner as Dahlias.
C. crassifolia is the only species besides the two above mentioned,
suitable for the flower garden.

 obtuse, margin entire--stamens six--filaments inserted at the base of
 the petals--anthers oblong--style one--stigma very small--germen large.


This plant, formerly known as Amaryllis lutea, is a native of the South
of Europe, and various parts of the East. Though introduced into this
country as early as 1596, it is by no means common. When planted in the
front of the borders it is very ornamental, particularly when exposed
to a bright sun, which causes the flowers to expand. It has acquired
a more interesting character, from the supposition entertained by the
late Sir J. E. Smith, that it may possibly be the Lily of Scripture, to
which we find such beautiful allusions in the Sacred writings. Sir J.
E. S. observes, "It is natural to presume the Divine Teacher, according
to his usual custom, called the attention of his hearers to some
object at hand; and, as the fields of the Levant are overrun with the
Amaryllis lutea, whose golden liliaceous flowers in Autumn afford one
of the most brilliant and gorgeous objects in nature, the expression of
'Solomon, in all his glory, not being arrayed like one of these,' is
peculiarly appropriate." It is a plant of easy cultivation, perfectly
hardy, and will grow in any good garden soil. At present there are few
species of this genus.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
